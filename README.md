# React Facts Website

I am trying to familiarise myself with using GitHub and GitHub pages with React. I wanted to originally just copy and paste my files into a repo in GitHub, but that doesn't really work if you used the normal "create react app" and try to copy and paste folders to the Repo. Instead, I've used the setup from this: https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages to get me started.

Learnings:
1) I can use GitHub pages to deploy the website from the project using the above linked installation and using npm run deploy after I've committed to main
2) After deploying a commit to the main, and also running npm run deploy again in CMD, it removes the readme file from the gh-pages branch
3) The website can be accessed here https://timzw961.github.io/React-Facts-Website/
