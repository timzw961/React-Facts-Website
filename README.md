# React-Facts-Website

This is my first react project that I'm following on Scrimba. It's a free react course.

> I am also using this as an oppurtinity to learn how to use GitHub and GitHub pages to also display the websites that I create.

Learnings:
1) I have learnt how to complete this project on the Scrimba in-built web IDE
2) I have also learnt how to "create react app" with npm and so on, so that I can also create my react applications in my own local environment
3) I wanted to also be able to showcase these learnings in GitHub. I think it would be an easy way to refer back to my old projects and also to display them if I don't create my own portfolio website in the future
4)
